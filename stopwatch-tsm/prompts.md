# PROMPT 1

### General Requirements

1. **Senior Full Stack Developer:**
   - I want you to pretend to be a senior expert full stack developer.
   - Based on the images I share with you, develop a stopwatch and a countdown timer.
2. **File Structure:**
   - The application will consist of three files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`.
   - Apply best practices in the code.
   - Use pure JavaScript for the script.
   - Use Tailwind for the CSS.
   - Include comments and documentation in the code for easier understanding.

### Web Structure

1. **Web Screens:**
   - **Main screen:**
     - Display only an icon of the stopwatch and another of the countdown timer, along with their titles.
   - **Stopwatch screen:**
     - Based on the structure and style of the provided image.
   - **Countdown timer screen:**
     - Based on the structure and style of the provided image.

### Functionality

1. **Stopwatch:**
   - Must have start, stop, and reset functions.
   - When starting the stopwatch, the "start" button should change to "pause", and when paused, it should appear as "continue".
   - When pressing the back button, the stopwatch should automatically reset.
2. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Must have set, start, stop, and reset functions.
   - When starting the countdown, the "start" button should change to "pause", and when paused, it should appear as "continue".
   - It should allow the user to set a custom time before starting the countdown.
   - Users should be able to set hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - When the countdown ends, a simple popup-style alert should appear.
   - When pressing the back button, the countdown should automatically reset.
3. **Common:**
   - The back button to the main page should be present on both the stopwatch and countdown timer pages.

### Design

1. **Display:**
   - Both the stopwatch and countdown timer displays should be large, visible, and well-centered.
   - Milliseconds should be displayed in a smaller font size than hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - Use modern icons from Google Material Icons for the main page, stopwatch, countdown timer, and the back to the main page button.
   - The colors and overall style of the buttons and display should be monochromatic, using yellow for the reset button.
   - The back button should be a back arrow icon.

**IMPORTANT:** Before developing the code, resolve all your doubts by asking me whatever you need to ensure your development is precise and efficient.

#2

Below I tell you the changes I want you to make to the design:

- On the stopwatch and countdown screen, milliseconds should be displayed in a smaller font size than hours, minutes, and seconds.
- The colors and overall style of the buttons and display should be monochromatic, using yellow for the reset button.
- Add some hover effect.
- Moves the back icon above the display on both the stopwatch and countdown screens.
- Make an alarm sound when the countdown ends
- Change the hover color from blue to green on the stopwatch icon and from blue to red on the count icon

**IMPORTANT:** **Make sure that everything works correctly and you adapted all the points that I described in the previous requirements**
