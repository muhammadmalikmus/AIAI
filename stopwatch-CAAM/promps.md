## frist try
Create a page with a Stopwatch function, on this repository https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/tree/5dd65c497bdd0c87e62e28928672f052156a870e/stopwatch-CAAM

the expected functionality is

to click on start button to start a chronometer
the chronometer or watch will show the pass of time
after selecting start the start button will change to a stop button
if the user clicks on the stop button the count will stop and the button will change from stop to continue.
if the user clicks on continue button the count will resume
if the user instead clicks on clear on any moment i will go back to default, chronometer on cero and the start button
for all the visual aspects use for reference this picture
https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/blob/main/res/stopwatch.png
and this page https://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/

the ouput will be expected to be on index-html and script.js use the files on template folder as a reference, also provide comments and follow coding and testing best practices

## second try

Create a page with a Stopwatch function on index-html and script.js files, use this folder as a reference, templates https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/tree/main/stopwatch-CAAM/template

the expected functionalities are:

- click the "Start" blue button so the watch will start running.
- after clicking on the "Start" button it will change to a "Pause" green button
- if the user clicks on the "Stop" button the count will stop and the button will change to a "Continue" blue button.
- if the user clicks on the "Continue" button the count will continue
- if the user instead clicks on the "Clear" red button at any moment it will reset the count, where the watch is on cero and the start button is shown.

For all the visual aspects:
- use for reference this picture https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/blob/main/res/stopwatch.png and this page https://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/
- make sure it is responsive and there is no glitching as the button's text and watch numbers change.

the output will be expected to be on index-html and script.js. each file should have comments on how it works and follow coding and testing best practices

## third try

Create a page with a Stopwatch function on index-html and script.js files, use this folder as a reference, templates https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/tree/main/stopwatch-CAAM/template

the expected functionalities are:

- click the "Start" blue button so the watch will start running.
- after clicking on the "Start" button it will change to a "Pause" green button

- if the user instead clicks on the "Clear" red button at any moment it will reset the count, where the watch is on cero and the start button is shown.

For all the visual aspects:
- Make it look just like this picture https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/blob/main/res/stopwatch.png 
- make sure it is responsive and there is no glitching as the button's text and watch numbers change container sizes.

the output will be expected to be on index-html and script.js. each file should have comments on how it works and follow coding and testing best practices

- buttons should have a black border and their text should be black bold
- the clock container should also have a black border
- the clock numbers should be big, black, and bold.
- the milliseconds should be under the seconds and be smaller 
- make sure it is responsive and there is no glitching as the button's text and watch numbers change container sizes.

the output will be expected to be on index-html and script.js. each file should have comments on how it works and follow coding and testing best practices
